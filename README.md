# Referee Rating System

An AI-assisted football referee performance rating system.

This project aims to evaluate referees objectively using:
- Match event data (StatsBomb Open Data)
- AI event detection (YOLOv8 + OpenCV)
- Rating algorithm (1–10 score similar to SofaScore)

## Features (MVP)

✅ Search for referee profiles  
✅ View ratings from recent matches  
✅ Breakdown by fouls, cards, decisions, VAR events  
✅ Event detection model flags potential incidents  
✅ Human reviewers verify correctness of decisions
